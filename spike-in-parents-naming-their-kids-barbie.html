Sure, it's not getting as much love as Barbie, but that increase definitely seems "Kenough."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>people who name their kids after like famous people/things kinda upset me cuz why are you naming your kid barbie???</p>— maremare 🌙 (@curlyhairqyeen) <a href=#>October 16, 2022</a></figure><p>There have been a slew of other popular TV shows and movies that have inspired folks to name their children after popular characters in recent years as well. Here are some notable examples.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Game of Thrones' — Khaleesi</h2><p>It was reported that in 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">560 moms</a> decided to name their child "Khaleesi" — named after Daenerys, the young mother of dragons in the wildly popular HBO series based on George R.R. Martin's book series "A Song of Ice and Fire."</p><p>In the show, Daenerys comes from a line of incestuously insane who routinely procreated with one another and commanded mythical creatures to burn people alive. She dies at around 23 or 24 years old, after being murdered by one of her relatives, upon succumbing to madness herself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just saw a white former classmate of mine on Facebook mocking the idea of naming a kid Wakanda and I was like bro you named your daughter Khaleesi have a seat and then he blocked me.</p>— The Volatile Mermaid (@OhNoSheTwitnt) <a href=#>February 19, 2018</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'The Notebook' — Noah</h2><p>Ryan Gosling strikes again: the London, Canada native's character from the melodrama based on Nichols Sparks's book of the same name <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired a slew of moms</a> to name their kids after a guy who was named after a guy who put a bunch of animals on a boat. Gosling's Noah, on the other hand, got into frustrating and oftentimes toxic relationship squabbles with Rachel McAdams.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Harry Potter' — Hermione</h2><p>Naming your kid after a Harry Potter character in 2023 would probably get your baby put on some kind of hate-watch list, but before J.K. Rowling was labeled as an enemy of the trans movement, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there were throngs of folks naming their babies after the capable and lovable wizard</a> who ends up with a ginger kid whose last name is Weasley.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>you always hear about nerd parents naming their kids Hermione and Khaleesi but you never hear them name a kid Chewbacca</p>— purgatory drifter 🐰 (@Tyrannorabbit) <a href=#>January 27, 2016</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Mickey Mouse' — Mickey</h2><p>Disney is oftentimes considered the God of media companies, so it's only appropriate that the company's trademark character carries a name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebraic origins that means pretty much just that</a>.</p><p>It should be noted to that without failure, every time the Mouse debuts a new Disney princess, there are almost <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">always throngs of parents who name their children after them</a>: Elsa from Frozen, Jasmine from Aladdin, and even someone <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who said they named their baby Maleficent</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can't say anything about these parents naming their kid Jafar.
