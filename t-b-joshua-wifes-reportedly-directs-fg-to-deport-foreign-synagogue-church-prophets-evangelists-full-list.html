The prayer mountain which is a few minutes drive from the main church has been the residence of the late Senior Prophet, the five junior prophets and some of the evangelists, while the remaining evangelists stayed at the church.</p><p>“The five prophets who include an American, a Briton, a French and two Nigerians were swooped upon and forcibly ejected from the prayer mountain and carried to the church. Their rooms were broken into and ransacked. Meanwhile, the evangelists in the church were also rounded up and manhandled by the security operatives with the church security personnel as they pulled them out of their various departments and some ex-workers and ex-disciples were immediately drafted in to take over those departments which include the accounts, studio and Emmanuel TV transmission room.</p><p>“The five prophets and the disciples, both Nigerians and foreign nationals were held hostage the whole day and their handsets seized from them. Currently, all the Nigerian disciples have been shamefully evicted from the church and the foreign ones have also been deported to their various countries. She also petitioned 20 of the evangelists and prophets, both Nigerians and foreign nationals to the EFCC for alleged theft, fraud and money laundering. The allegations are absolutely baseless. The case has been filed in court and EFCC has been served a restraining order since September 2021.</p><p>“Despite the restraining order, some EFCC officials with some security operatives still stormed the residence of the evangelists and prophetesses whose names are on the alleged list and arrested one of the evangelists yesterday.</p><p>“Mrs Evelyn Joshua has also deported those foreign prophets and evangelists whose names are on the EFCC list to their countries without the matter being investigated. Even though they insisted that they wanted their names to be cleared of allegations before leaving Nigeria, they were however forcibly deported on one-way tickets. Currently, the entire discipleship of the SCOAN has been disbanded and flushed out of the church by Mrs Evelyn Joshua who has now fully taken over the church administration as the new General Overseer.</p><p>“All the disciples she accused of fraud were not charged to court but surreptitiously deported from the country on the 9th of October. Two days after she deported all of the foreigners claiming that she had withdrawn the EFCC case against them without any investigation, the EFCC officials started hunting the Nigerian disciples,” a source told SaharaReporters</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BxZq1lkmK3sL%2FHrphmr5mbsrR50Z6nqKqkmrGtxYydoKudk6nAbrLGZquoZZSavbC%2B02adqKqVnrSvedKypZqfn5zCpnnCoayrm5hivbO7z6GcratdmsOiusaeo6KrpKh6p8HLpWSloaOpfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ft-b-joshua-wifes-reportedly-directs-fg-to-deport-foreign-synagogue-church-prophets-evangelists-full-list.html&text=T.B.%20Joshua%20Wife%27s%20Reportedly%20Directs%20FG%20To%20Deport%20Foreign%20Synagogue%20Church%20Prophets%2c%20Evangelists%20%5bF&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ft-b-joshua-wifes-reportedly-directs-fg-to-deport-foreign-synagogue-church-prophets-evangelists-full-list.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ft-b-joshua-wifes-reportedly-directs-fg-to-deport-foreign-synagogue-church-prophets-evangelists-full-list.html&title=T.B.%20Joshua%20Wife%27s%20Reportedly%20Directs%20FG%20To%20Deport%20Foreign%20Synagogue%20Church%20Prophets%2c%20Evangelists%20%5bF" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ft-b-joshua-wifes-reportedly-directs-fg-to-deport-foreign-synagogue-church-prophets-evangelists-full-list.html&title=T.B.%20Joshua%20Wife%27s%20Reportedly%20Directs%20FG%20To%20Deport%20Foreign%20Synagogue%20Church%20Prophets%2c%20Evangelists%20%5bF" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ft-b-joshua-wifes-reportedly-directs-fg-to-deport-foreign-synagogue-church-prophets-evangelists-full-list.html&title=T.B.%20Joshua%20Wife%27s%20Reportedly%20Directs%20FG%20To%20Deport%20Foreign%20Synagogue%20Church%20Prophets%2c%20Evangelists%20%5bF" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ft-b-joshua-wifes-reportedly-directs-fg-to-deport-foreign-synagogue-church-prophets-evangelists-full-list.html&description=T.B.%20Joshua%20Wife%27s%20Reportedly%20Directs%20FG%20To%20Deport%20Foreign%20Synagogue%20Church%20Prophets%2c%20Evangelists%20%5bF" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-i-resigned-as-fbn-holdings-chairman-babalola.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why I Resigned As FBN Holdings Chairman">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./56185-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PHOTO: Ladies, You Will Be Interested In What Paul Okoye Is Hiding">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
