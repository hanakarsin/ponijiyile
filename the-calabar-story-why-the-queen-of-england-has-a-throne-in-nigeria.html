They worked on the docks, loading and unloading ships, and supplying foreigners with food and other provisions.</p><p>“Kings became very wealthy. Families became large. They controlled the greatest amount of slaves from Africa,” says Duke.</p><h2>Eyewitness account of the slave trade</h2><p>More than 1.5 million Africans were shipped to what was then called the New World – the Americas – through the port of Calabar in Bonny Bay, making it one of the largest points of exit from transatlantic trade.</p><p>A book containing the 18th-century diary of an Efik slave trader – written in pidgin English and discovered in the archives of Scottish missionaries – was published in 1956.</p><p>Entitled “The Diary of Antera Duke”, it is the only account of the slave trade by an African merchant.</p><p>“We went down with Tom Cooper and the captain of the Comberbach dinghy, got on board at 2 a.m. and got it all sorted out, and he unloaded Duke and us 143 barrels of gunpowder and 984 brass,” can we read in an entry.</p><h2>Queen Elizabeth moves to stop slave trade in Calabar</h2><p>Decades after Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807, human cargoes were still transported to other countries via Calabar.</p><p>“It was important that Queen Victoria had the kings of Calabar on her side,” says Duke.</p><p>“She wrote a letter asking that they stop trading in people and start trading in spices, palm oil, glassware and other things.”</p><p>This is where the myth begins.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-564260 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/King-Efiks-crown-and-cape-are-from-England.webp alt="King Efik's crown and cape are from England." width=480 height=591 sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-564260 class=wp-caption-text>King Efik’s crown and cape are from England.</p><p>In her letter to King Eyamba, Queen Victoria offers him incentives, including the protection of his people.</p><p>She then signs off as “Queen Victoria, Queen of England”, which a local interpreter incorrectly translates as “Queen Victoria, Queen of all Whites”.</p><h2 class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">This is where the myth begins</h2><p>King Eyamba decides that if he accepts the protection of a woman, they must marry.

Even during the ceremony, they still told that story,” she says.</p><p>“Prince Michael was delighted to hear of the historic links between the Efik and British royalty and was honoured to deepen those ties with his Efik chiefdom,” she adds.</p><h2>The Obong of Calabar has two thrones, one is&nbsp;reserved for the Queen of England</h2><p>In keeping with the tradition that began after the “marriage” of King Eyamba to Queen Victoria, the coronation of the Obong of Calabar always takes place in two phases.</p><p>After the traditional rites are completed in the community, the coronation ceremony continues in a Presbyterian church (formerly the Church of Scotland), where the Obong wears a crown and cape custom-made for the occasion in England.</p><p>Two thrones are placed side by side and he sits on one of them, while the second is left empty for the absent Queen of England (or a Bible is placed there).
