Here are some of the most trending Luo songs.</p><h3><strong>1. Nyasaye Marahuma by Eunice Ogoma</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>Nyasaye Marahuma is a song that tells of a young woman’s journey in salvation. Here is a story of a young Christian who dedicated her life to serving Jesus Christ, but in the eyes of the society, she is seen as a failure because she does not meet any of the societal expectations pegged on her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/522e520119204eec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nadia Mukami: 10 cutest photos of the Kenyan singer-songwriter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As many of her agemates are getting married, she still does not even have a suitor who is seriously engaged to her. When she takes even longer to get married, relatives begin to talk, others suggesting that they can find her an old man to marry her because her days of finding a suitable husband have elapsed. Later, when they begin to see the beautiful things God does for her, they begin to encourage her to continue worshipping God because they now see that the God she worships is a living God.</p><p class=align-left>It is very rare for a vernacular song to gather more than a million views on YouTube, this song as surpassed that mark. The song is very relatable because as Christians we are always waiting upon God to help us achieve something. However, having the patience to wait until he does is the hurdle that most Christians cannot overcome. This song will give you the courage to stay steadfast as you wait upon God to fulfill his promises.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8171740444f9650.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kush Tracey: 10 hottest photos you should check out</span></p></a><p class=align-left>‘Nyasaye Marahuma’ translates to ‘miraculous God,’ throughout the lyrics; you learn that God works in mysterious ways to fulfill his promises for those who worship him in true spirit.</p><p class=align-left>This song is currently one of the dominant Luo gospel worship songs in open air crusades and churches in Kisumu and other Luo-inhabited regions in Kenya.</p><p class=align-left>This song, apart from being an uplifting song that will give the strength to walk with God even in those difficult times also uplifts the name of God. She talks about God as someone who has experienced the beauty of being in covenant with God. This song should be translated into many languages, not only because of the message but also of the beautiful composition.</p><h3><strong>2. Jakayuda Iberna - Joan Amayo</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>Have you ever sat down and looked back at where Jesus met you? You would concur with me that Jesus can take you from a derelict to someone people refer to when talking about people who can make a change. This song is about a woman who Jesus saved from her evil ways and is therefore very grateful that Jesus showed him the right path to walk and how to live her life in a manner that pleases God.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/34fbb852f8820c3e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=#><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best Luhya gospel songs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The song is a celebratory song, and the happy dances in the video can attest to the happiness of the woman for having got the salvation. The song also features a young man with superb vocals; he mentions all the stuff that Jesus saved him from and why he shall stick to worshiping Jesus for as long as he lives.</p><p class=align-left>The audio mastery of this song is done by John Okidi, who has composed some of the best Luo gospel songs.</p><p class=align-left>This tune is the right song to celebrate every milestone you have made in salvation. It reminds of the hope, love, and family one finds in Christ.</p><h3><strong>3. Wir Mari - Jalogo Elijah</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>Who wouldn’t like to be anointed by Jesus Christ? This song talks about a person’s desire to be anointed by the powerful name of Jesus Christ. He talks of how anointment by Jesus Christ makes the devil afraid and allows one to grow in all aspects of life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs2ufi85eccgq.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top trending Tanzania Gospel music</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He mentions how Jesus enabled Bartimaeus the blind to see just by smearing mud on his eyes. We all need anointment to break the malicious spells that bind us to the paths we no longer want to follow. If you need the power of Jesus Christ and all the favour that comes with his anointing around you, then this song will be a good tune to encourage you on the way.</p><p class=align-left>The song is one of the latest Luo gospel songs that are both spiced in lyrical content and instruments. The song is fast-paced and danceable and suits a praise session in church and open-air crusades.</p><p class=align-left>The video features different groups dancing in systematic moves that are easy to copy and blends well with the instruments.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the song is entirely sung in Dholuo but has subtitles for all the words spoken. The subtitles are in English. Therefore it broadens the audience as any person who understands English can know all the song is about.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3d04bqn37pf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best Catholic Swahili songs</span></p></a><h3><strong>4. Wuon Nyidho By Apostle Darlan Rukih</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>Darlan Rukih is a famous evangelist who does not only serve the Luo in Kenya but also evangelizes in Tanzania among other parts of the world. This song titled ‘Wuon Nyidho’ translates to ‘Owner of Rains.’ This song is a praise that is known by nearly every Luo in praise circles. The song uses a lot of parables and proverbs. It takes a keen ear and an excellent mind to unfurl some of the hidden meanings in the lyrics.</p><p class=align-left>What will amaze you is the vocal prowess of the Apostle, he creates a beautiful rhythm that keeps rising from the beginning to the end, such that in the crescendo, everything and everyone seems to be in motion; taken to spiritual heights by the message in the song. This song was released in 2012 but still competes with new Luo gospel songs on the airwaves. It is one of the songs that you can listen to when you want to celebrate the power of Jesus in your life.</p><h3><strong>5. Wuoth bor by Rosemary Ayatta</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>This song is about the journey of heaven. ‘Wuoth bor’ translates to ‘The journey is long.’ It talks about all the sufferings that a Christian might go through in her salvation.</p><p class=align-left>In the song, the singer mentions that you cannot make it to heaven if you don’t have God’s forgiveness. You must be with God all the way through; every day is seeking refuge in him when the thing doesn’t turn out right as you thought. When the journey of salvation becomes unbearable, you should not backslide, but find strength from the author of salvation— Jesus.</p><p class=align-left>What I love most about this song is how the singer speaks in plain truth; she does not try to make you think that salvation is a smooth ride. She acknowledges that salvation is not easy, but you have already won the fight against the temptations if you keep your faith anchored on the rock of salvation.</p><p class=align-left>She says; ‘Ked akeda, wadhi e paradiso’ which translates to ‘Just fight we are going to paradise.’ She further mentions what keep people losing faith in God and his promises like joblessness, broken families, and sicknesses, but she assures her listeners that when you keep grounded on faith, then God will answer all your prayers.</p><p class=align-left>The song is powerful in lyrical content, but also the production is well-done as the song syncs perfectly with the beats. For its powerful worship undertones, if anyone made a list of top ten Luo gospel songs, and this song missed, then he obviously does not have an ear for good gospel music.</p><h3><strong>6. Lwandana by Carol David</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>As Christians, Jesus Christ is our rock. That is why we go forth in our daily hustles without fear because we know we are founded on the rock that cannot be swayed by the pressures of life. We often ask ourselves what life would be like if there was a friend we could cry on when things go wrong, this song, makes it clear that Jesus’ name is the only name that you can call on, and all your troubles will find solutions. She says that Jesus is the only person who can take away your shame, poverty, sin, and make you a better person than you ever thought you ever would become.</p><p class=align-left>The song is authoritative and lays it bare that Jesus is the only authority he recognizes, and the only saviour who can fight the demons we battle with every day as Christians.</p><p class=align-left>For this song, you will not only enjoy the visuals, but you will understand what the song is about as it comes with subtitles in the English language.</p><h3><strong>7. Yesu Neni by John Okidi</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>This song is very uplifting. John Okidi did so many songs, but this one, I believe, he created to help those who are going through hard times. It is one of those timeless Kenyan Luo gospel songs that will always be trending. It does not matter what kind of trouble you are going through this song will give you so much hope to face tomorrow.</p><p class=align-left>What I love about this song is that it does not bundle all the sufferings of humans in one blanket. It mentions them one by, which elicits graphic imagery in his lyrics. This kind of composition is poetic, but also appeals to your emotional spheres and connects your physical needs to your spiritual well-being.</p><p class=align-left>The title, ‘Yesu Neni’ means ‘Jesus sees you.’ Whatever situation you are in, Jesus is seeing your struggles and will help you win your battles. He mentions that, even if you have HIV/AIDS and you think all is lost, when relatives are dividing your wealth as they know you will die, you should not lose hope, because if Jesus Christ healed the dead, HIV/AIDS cannot be a threat to him.</p><p class=align-left>This song speaks to those who have been declared hopeless by the society. It can speak to you right now; it doesn’t matter the problem, he advises, do not commit suicide, for Jesus is watching you and will not allow all the hard times you have gone through to sweep you under.</p><p class=align-left>This song was released so many years ago, perhaps in 2006, but is still played in every night vigil, especially to calm the hearts of those who have lost their loved ones. It is a song that is best suited for those who are almost losing hope in life and in the God they have served all their lives. This song has subtitles. Therefore you can know all that he is singing about, but even if it didn’t have just from the rhythm and the voice, you would be calmed. Music knows no language; this song is a testament to that.</p><h3><strong>8. Warwaki Yesu by John Okidi</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>This is a worship song that is done in slow-pace to give room for spiritual elevation. The pace is not danceable, but you can sway in celebration of the glory of Jesus Christ. The song is about welcoming Jesus in our midst as Christians as when we welcome him everything goes well.</p><p class=align-left>When you listen to this song, you learn that Jesus is there for all of us, but he can only dwell in the hearts of those who have welcomed him. The song also reminds us of the choices that God bestows upon us; to either accept, welcome and allow Jesus to live within us or to fight our own burdens ourselves. As Christians, we draw our strength from Jesus, and we can only live better lives and experience spiritual oases when we welcome Jesus Christ to live within and be a part of every activity that we initiate so that it can have a beautiful ending.</p><p class=align-left>He also mentions all the benefits any Christian can gain by welcoming Jesus in his lives. When we welcome Jesus in our midst, the sick will get cured, the hungry will get fed, the lost will find belonging and the poor in spirit shall be nourished. See, we can gain so much by welcoming Christ into our lives; it is, therefore, the right thing to do— give him a space in our hearts.</p><p class=align-left>The song has subtitles, and as such, you can enjoy the calm the instruments bring and understand what the singer is talking about irrespective of your tribe.</p><h3><strong>9. Kwe Kende by Rosemary Ogonya</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>This song is a call for every Christian to preach peace. The song says that we might be coming from different backgrounds, but God created by his own hands, and we can speak the language of humanity. This song also talks about how some people do not have anything that can be termed as wealth by the materialistic world standards, but they have peace in their hearts, and that only comes from God, and it is the most significant wealth.</p><p class=align-left>The singer advises Christians not to get lost in the hustle to get the worldly pleasures and wealth. She encourages us that we have our wealth in heaven kept for us, and we should have all our focus on that as termites and pests can consume worldly wealth, but our heavenly rewards are safely kept awaiting us to fight the battle to the end. The song is both a praise and therapeutic tune; perhaps it is this versatility that has got it featured in Luo gospel songs mix by many deejays.</p><h3><strong>10. Lweny Mar Roho by Sarah Brenda</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>This song reminds us that the battles we are fighting as Christians are spiritual battles and not physical wars. The singer talks of how easy we can be winning the wars we fight if we allowed God to take the lead as we follow behind him at a safer distance.</p><p class=align-left>She calls on God to be with her in the journey of salvation so that she can reach heaven. She declares that she has a lot of thirst for worldly pleasures and doubts for what God offers, but is hopeful that all these doubts can be settled if God takes the lead.</p><p class=align-left>The video is set on beautiful landscapes, featuring fountains on green hills and vast barren lands. If you are a big fan of gospel songs that are dominated by vulnerable lyrics— those lyrics that cries of your powerlessness and how you cannot live a life worth living without God, then this song will help you bring your burdens to the cross as God takes the lead, winning the spiritual battles for you.</p><h3><strong>11. Bi Isira By Rosemary Ayatta</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>Are you struggling with you sufferings along the path of salvation and you feel like no one can be of help to you? Maybe it is time you called on God to be your pillar as everything you’re are going through is weighing you down.</p><p class=align-left>“Bi Isira” loosely translates to “Come to support me,” the whole song is a cry to God to support her faith so that she does not fall back into sin. I love the song because it shows us that plain truth that salvation alone is not enough, but you have to be steadfast, always asking God to reinforce your spiritual strength whenever you feel spiritually malnourished. This song also declares that without Jesus, we as Christians have no power to keep walking and winning battles that threaten to take burry us deep in the abyss of sin.</p><p class=align-left>It does not matter whether you understand the Luo language or not; this song can help you reconnect with your faith. Among the Luos it is one of the Top Luo gospel songs that every church plays during worship sessions. If you want to have a lengthy worship session with fellow church members or just alone in the house, this song will be the best, to begin with as it calms you down for spiritual elevation that comes with lengthy worship. You can also use it as an interlude as you want to switch to a different prayer item.</p><h3><strong>12 Ere Ng’ama Loyi by Phoebe Moses</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>There is an agreement among Christians that there is no stronger person than Jesus Christ. He is the only one who can transform your life from filth to a gift. This song asks if there is any person who is greater than Jesus but proceeds to answer that no one is stronger than Jesus Christ. He is the one who made us into existence and lives through us to ensure we thrive in our daily lives.</p><p class=align-left>She mentions that she hides under the rock of Jesus as when enemies try to harm her. As Christians the only haven that we can run to when pressures of life threaten to bring us down spiritually. She states that it is only in Christ that we can defeat the devil who is continually trying to bring us to shame and lethargy. You can listen to this song when you are feeling low; it will satiate your spiritual needs.</p><h2>Luo SDA gospel songs</h2><p class=align-left>Here are more gospel songs by the Luo SDA faithfuls:</p><h3><strong>13. Onge Ber E Pinyni by Redemption Ministries</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>This song is done in a sombre mood as it talks about all the pain that people go through in the world. “Onge Maber E pinyni’ translates to ‘There is no goodness in the world.” In the video, the song features heinous acts of human beings against one another, especially during election periods.</p><p class=align-left>The singers acknowledge that there is nothing in the world. People are very hateful, the systems are so crooked, the rich are manipulating the poor to work in their favour, and the widows are robbed of wealth they rightfully own. They are now asking Jesus to do them good so that they can overcome the challenges of living on earth.</p><p class=align-left>The song is done in characteristic SDA choir that features all the vocal ranges to bring a harmonious tune. The video syncs well with the message in the song— it features weeping faces and troubled children. The most amazing thing with the song is that it recognises that amidst all the bad happenings in the world, only Jesus can do good to those who believe in him.</p><h3><strong>14. Mon Mabeyo by Gospel Trumpet</strong></h3><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>If you are in search of a woman worthy of making a wife, this song can help gauge the right qualities to look for. It talks about the beauty that a good woman adds to the home. She is someone who is strong and able to keep her husband nourished and her children well-behaved.</p><p class=align-left>It also talks about a man’s responsibility to respect the woman she has taken as a wife and together they can raise a home that is peaceful and children who are prosperous in whatever they do.</p><p class=align-left>The song tells of how a good wife thinks about the actions of her words before speaking them and how she stays true to the husband. This song is one of the best Luo gospel wedding songs. It does not only talk about the qualities of a good wife but also talks about how these good qualities will impact her home and command respect from her husband. Like most SDA songs, this song is slow-paced and all words are well enunciated to make sure the content reigns supreme over other musical features. The song says that good wife is worth more than other precious stones.</p><h2>Catholic Luo gospel songs</h2><p class=align-left>Catholic faithfuls have also not been left behind when it comes to the creation of interesting gospel tracks. Here are some of them.</p><h3><strong>15.
