"I’d started modeling, and my manager was actually a childhood friend of his."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>She continued, "And one day, my manager and I were meeting at a Starbucks — and then directly after, I guess he was meeting up with Brandon. So I was walking out the door as Brandon was walking in, like a rom-com or something. And I guess he noticed me and asked about me. Like, 'Who was that?'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It took four months for me to actually say, 'Alright, fine.' I’m not big on athletes! Lol. Being an athlete myself, I just know the operation," Jade wrote. "Plus, I was living in France at the time to model. But he was trying, trying, trying. And eventually, I was like, 'Alright. Give him my number. Let’s see where this goes.'"</p><p>Jade described their dynamic as "sweet," later referring to Brandon as a "goofy, fun-loving man. ... I’m very similar, so we just mesh. He’s the person that calms me down, I guess you could say. He’s my peace."</p><p>In 2017, Jade and Brandon welcomed their first child, a daughter named Bailey Quinn Phillips.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In the <a href=#>1999 MLB draft</a>, Brandon was selected by the Montreal Expos in the second round; nearly three years later, he was traded to the Cleveland Guardians and started as the team's second baseman. By April 2006, Cleveland had enough and traded Brandon to the Cincinnati Reds, where he played for 10 years.</p><p>He later had brief stints with <a href=#>Atlanta Braves</a>, Los Angeles Angels, and the <a href=#>Boston Red Sox</a> before taking his talents to the Lexington Legends of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.
