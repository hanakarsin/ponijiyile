Quintanilla</a> — and as the older brother of the Queen of Tejano Music, <a href=#>Selena</a>) has been through a lot in his life. From his early years growing up in poverty to his rise to stardom alongside sister Selena, then losing her in the tragic shooting and ultimately rebuilding his life, A.B. has proved that there is no obstacle he cannot overcome.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, his contributions as a musician, songwriter, and producer are indisputable, but nothing brings A.B. more joy than his family. So <a href=#>who are A.B. Quintanilla’s wife and kids</a>?&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>A.B. Quintanilla III and family</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is A.B. Quintanilla’s wife?</h2><p>You’ve heard the term "serial dater" before, but have you ever heard of a serial marrier? Over the years, A.B. Quintanilla has had more wives than most people. His first marriage was at the age of 24 to a woman named Evangelina Almeida. The two married on April 17, 1988 in Corpus Christi, one year before Selena’s self-titled album would change her life and the lives of her family members forever.&nbsp;</p><p>As Selena’s career started to take off, so did A.B.'s, being that he was Selena’s primary record producer and songwriter. But as we all know, Selena's career was cut tragically short when she was gunned down by her friend and boutique manager in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the loss was too much for A.B. and along with his career, his marriage suffered. The couple soon divorced.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by A.B. QUINTANILLA 3 (@abquintanilla3)</a></p></figure><p>After Selena’s death and the dissolution of the band, A.B. took some time away from music before resurfacing with his new act, the Kumbia Kings in 1999. Then, in 2002, he married his second wife, Heather Grein. The couple soon divorced and public records <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">show</a> that just two years after he had wed Heather, A.B. went on to marry his next wife, Brenda Ramirez, on December 31, 2004.</p><p>Unfortunately, that marriage didn’t last either. After Heather, A.B. married his fourth wife, longtime girlfriend Rikkie Leigh Robinson. They spent five years as a happy couple and even tried to have a child together, despite the fact that A.B. was already 52 at the time and a father to eight children from his past relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the couple didn’t have a baby. A.B. later announced during one of his concerts that he and Rikkie would be getting a divorce.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>A.B. and Anjelah</p></figure><p>A.B.’s fifth and current wife is an Argentine woman named Anjelah O. The two got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married</a> on September 16, 2019 in Las Vegas, although they kept their civil ceremony a secret for a while before disclosing the news to fans.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many kids does A.B. have?</h2><p>Given that he’s had five different wives, it comes as no surprise that A.B. has a lot of children: a total of eight, to be exact.&nbsp;</p><p>He had two sons with his first wife Evangelina: Svani, who was born in 1991, and Gianni, who was born in 2000. A.B. had two additional sons with his second wife Heather and also went on to have four other children between 1989 and 2007 (although it’s unclear exactly which wife had which child).</p><p>A.B.’s numerous children are a lot to keep up with, even for him. In 2017, he landed himself on a list of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top 10 most wanted fugitives</a> in Corpus Christi over unpaid child support payments. He spent a short time in Nueces County Jail before agreeing to pay the money he owed, which came out to around $87,000 in back payments, along with additional medical and attorney’s fees.</p><p>Hopefully, he’s keeping up with the support payments these days while enjoying life with current wife Anjelah O.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflq9uvdSipa2Znp65ra2MsKCfnV2gtqW%2F</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fab-quintanilla-wife-kids.html&text=Selena%27s%20Brother%20A.B.%20Quintanilla%20Has%20Had%20Several%20Wives%20Throughout%20the%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fab-quintanilla-wife-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fab-quintanilla-wife-kids.html&title=Selena%27s%20Brother%20A.B.%20Quintanilla%20Has%20Had%20Several%20Wives%20Throughout%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fab-quintanilla-wife-kids.html&title=Selena%27s%20Brother%20A.B.%20Quintanilla%20Has%20Had%20Several%20Wives%20Throughout%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fab-quintanilla-wife-kids.html&title=Selena%27s%20Brother%20A.B.%20Quintanilla%20Has%20Had%20Several%20Wives%20Throughout%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fab-quintanilla-wife-kids.html&description=Selena%27s%20Brother%20A.B.%20Quintanilla%20Has%20Had%20Several%20Wives%20Throughout%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./623514-ministers-wont-get-portfolio-president-buhari-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Buhari: Some Ministers Won't Get Any Portfolio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./331259-noah-wekesa-rais-kenyatta-ni-mchanga-sana-hatastaafu-2022-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Noah Wekesa: Rais Kenyatta ni mchanga sana, hatastaafu 2022">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
