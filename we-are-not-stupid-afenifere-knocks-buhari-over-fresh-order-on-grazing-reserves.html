Grazing reserves are areas of land demarcated, set aside and reserved for exclusive or semi-exclusive use by pastoralists”</p><p>Afenifere observed that the fresh move is worse than RUGA and other previous ideas of the current government which the southern people and their governors have clearly rejected.</p><p>“Currently, Nigeria has a total of 417 grazing reserves all over the country, out of which only about 113 have been gazetted. Thus, the present policy of the Buhari administration on Grazing Reserves is the implementation of the script by the Fulani intelligentsia.</p><p>“The recommendations which pandered to deceptive national solutions to orchestrated farmers/herders clash, nonetheless reek of the odiferous stench of ethnic agenda for settlement of the Fulani in the ancestral lands of other ethnic nationalities.</p><p>“The non-Fulani Nigerians are not stupid, as the Federal Government, probably imagine, not to know that the concept of Grazing Reserve, by the Gambari and Jega definitions above, is a worse form of official dispossession of their ancestral lands for the inheritance and use of the Fulani than Cattle Colony, RUGA and Grazing Routes which they have roundly rejected.</p><p>“We recall and support the resolutions of the Nigerian Governors, particularly from the south of the country, banning all forms of open grazing and it does not matter to us that some elected governors, in a federation, would condescend so low to function as members of a Committee presided over by an appointed aide of the President, no matter the name in which his office is painted.</p><p>“The concept of Grazing Reserves, otherwise known as Hurumi, which was introduced during the colonial and immediately after independence failed in the north particularly in the Middle Belt provinces, notwithstanding a monolithic one North government and permissive land-use regime.</p><p>“For the umpteenth time, let the President be told that the constitution which he reveres relentlessly and the Land Use Act which derives equal force therefrom, extols the majesty of the people over their land.</p><p>“Even the Governor who holds the land in his state in trust for the people cannot dispossess any citizen thereof, except for proven overriding public interest through the due process of law.</p><p>“The current exercise is not only a waste of taxpayers money but also a sweet pipe dream in a fool’s paradise. Every herder has a state of origin. Let the governments of the respective states make arrangements for settled life for them in the territory where the culture is fully appreciated,” the statement added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FpZrCdXZa%2FpnnNqKtmq6SqvaqwjJqdnqaZm7KzsYykpaibm6h6o8HHmqmiZZ%2BrsrN5xaucrKBdpL%2BlsdFmpqdll6euu7XNoGSrnaOav7ex0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwe-are-not-stupid-afenifere-knocks-buhari-over-fresh-order-on-grazing-reserves.html&text=We%20Are%20Not%20Stupid%20-%20Afenifere%20Knocks%20Buhari%20Over%20Fresh%20Order%20On%20Grazing%20Reserves&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwe-are-not-stupid-afenifere-knocks-buhari-over-fresh-order-on-grazing-reserves.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwe-are-not-stupid-afenifere-knocks-buhari-over-fresh-order-on-grazing-reserves.html&title=We%20Are%20Not%20Stupid%20-%20Afenifere%20Knocks%20Buhari%20Over%20Fresh%20Order%20On%20Grazing%20Reserves" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwe-are-not-stupid-afenifere-knocks-buhari-over-fresh-order-on-grazing-reserves.html&title=We%20Are%20Not%20Stupid%20-%20Afenifere%20Knocks%20Buhari%20Over%20Fresh%20Order%20On%20Grazing%20Reserves" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwe-are-not-stupid-afenifere-knocks-buhari-over-fresh-order-on-grazing-reserves.html&title=We%20Are%20Not%20Stupid%20-%20Afenifere%20Knocks%20Buhari%20Over%20Fresh%20Order%20On%20Grazing%20Reserves" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwe-are-not-stupid-afenifere-knocks-buhari-over-fresh-order-on-grazing-reserves.html&description=We%20Are%20Not%20Stupid%20-%20Afenifere%20Knocks%20Buhari%20Over%20Fresh%20Order%20On%20Grazing%20Reserves" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./yul-edochie-speaks-on-ritual-killings-reveals-why-people-engage-in-crime.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yul Edochie Speaks On Ritual Killings, Reveals Why People Engage In Crime">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bolaji-oreagba.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Read All The Latest News About Bolaji Oreagba On Naija News">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
