Well, if you've seen any of his early fights, then you'll know exactly why.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>There are some <a href=#>mixed martial arts fighters</a> that have some pretty confusing nicknames that need a little bit of explaining to fully understand. Like where Rich Franklin got his "Ace" moniker (hint: it's because he kinda looks like Jim Carrey and people conflated him with Ace Ventura).&nbsp;</p><p>Then there are other fighters who, upon watching them scrap, have monikers that fit completely, like why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chan Sung Jung</a> is called "The Korean Zombie."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So why is Chan called "The Korean Zombie?"</h2><p>If you've ever watched any of Chan's early MMA bouts then one thing was immediately clear, he was the kind of pugilist who moved forward no matter what was going on. Seriously, anything.&nbsp;</p><p>You could punch and kick the guy in the face, hit him with your hardest shots, and for the most part, he would never falter. And even if he did manage to get knocked down he'd come right back up and ready to throw bombs at your face.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>In fact, his scrap against Leonard Garcia, which was contested on March 26, 2011, was a ridiculously close affair that saw the two 145lb-ers smash each other in the face for three consecutive rounds and never showing any signs of quit.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though this fight is nearly a decade old as of this writing, it's still a bout that MMA fans remember fondly.</p><p>Not for its technical prowess, but mainly because it looked like a scene out of a Rocky film: there was zero defense and just straight-up swinging for the fences in an attempt to knock each other out. Both men were beaten to a pulp, but they were both still standing at the end of it all.</p><p>Interestingly enough, shortly after that fight, Chan's MMA career was put on hold as he had to serve in the military, a mandatory rule in his native country of South Korea.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>But he was clearly training the entire time and had one goal on his mind: become a better martial artist, and he did.&nbsp;</p><p>While he relied on his iron chin and heavy hands for his first crop of fights, after he returned to the UFC he seemed to be a completely different fighter and one that fans were excited to see back inside the cage.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"The Korean Zombie" has a 21 and 5 record.</h2><p>His most recent falter was to Yair Rodriguez who nailed him with a highlight-reel-out-of-nowhere-upwards-elbow-KO. Prior to that, he lost to Jose Aldo... and this was prime Aldo we're talking about before he lost in a devastatingly unceremonious fashion to Connor McGregor.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Chan also lost that slobberknocker to Leonard Garcia (although it was really anyone's fight) but he definitively won the rematch with a twister submission.</p><p>He also holds victories over Dustin Poirier, Frankie Edgar, and Renato Moicano. His two last bouts were against not only recognizable names but pretty stalwart fighters in the UFC's super-stacked featherweight division.&nbsp;</p><p>Both of these victories were via TKO and he showcased not only his trademark ability to constantly move forward, but he's combined it with a scary precision and technical acumen that's put the rest of the brawlers in his weight class on notice.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brian Ortega shaved his hair off prior to his bout with "The Korean Zombie."</h2><p>Brian was fast-becoming the UFC's favorite fighter to rule the featherweight division: he's a heck of a combatant with an all-around game who can be competitive either standing up or grappling. On top of that he's well-spoken, good looking, and a positive role model, and many thought he'd give Max Holloway trouble when the two squared up.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>But he didn't — he was completely dominated on the feet by the Hawaiian fighter for five rounds and hasn't competed since. His last fight before his match against Chan Sung Jung was on December, 8 2018, so fans haven't seen him in action for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is why they were shocked to see his traditional long locks shaved from his head at the weigh-ins.</p><p>Brian donated his hair to the Locks of Love for children who are undergoing chemotherapy. Brian also made headlines recently when he got in a strange beef with Chan's manager, Jay Park who's also a K-Pop star, that culminated in the featherweight contender slapping him in the face.&nbsp;</p><p>Brian, in a now-deleted video, didn't apologize for the smack, stating that Jay was generating smack talk on Chan's behalf and stating that Brian "dodged" the fight.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Last night, you sat 10 meters away from me and Jay Park. For two hours nothing happened, so I thought everything was fine. But you fucking attacked Jay Park while I went to the bathroom. Jay Park is not a professional fighter but a musician. You slapped a civilian who merely helped translate. Even worse, you were sitting there waiting until I would be absent and attacked Jay Park. It was not a fight like real men would do. What you have done is same as a grown up to beat a child. You should have attacked me. If so, I would have not been upset. You are such a coward for slapping a musician not a fighter. If you fucking planned this to fight me and to use my name because people don't remember your name anymore, then I congratulate you, it worked. I will fight you and I will knock you out and your fucking face will be bloody. Now, your fucking face stays in my mind and I will fuck you up in the cage. I hope you won’t run away from me again.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>정찬성</a> (@koreanzombiemma) on Mar 8, 2020 at 5:23pm PDT</p></figure><p>Jay denies ever drumming up smack talk against Brian and added that it's not a good look nor does it make Brian look "tough" for smacking him as Brian's 40 pounds heavier than he is.</p><p>Let's leave the fighting to the professionals.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKGdXZiurbjEnWStoJViuLC%2BxJqlZrKfoq%2BqsQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-he-called-the-korean-zombie.html&text=%26quot%3bThe%20Korean%20Zombie%26quot%3b%20Earned%20His%20Nickname%20From%20His%20Exciting%20Fighting%20Style&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-he-called-the-korean-zombie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-he-called-the-korean-zombie.html&title=%26quot%3bThe%20Korean%20Zombie%26quot%3b%20Earned%20His%20Nickname%20From%20His%20Exciting%20Fighting%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-is-he-called-the-korean-zombie.html&title=%26quot%3bThe%20Korean%20Zombie%26quot%3b%20Earned%20His%20Nickname%20From%20His%20Exciting%20Fighting%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-he-called-the-korean-zombie.html&title=%26quot%3bThe%20Korean%20Zombie%26quot%3b%20Earned%20His%20Nickname%20From%20His%20Exciting%20Fighting%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-he-called-the-korean-zombie.html&description=%26quot%3bThe%20Korean%20Zombie%26quot%3b%20Earned%20His%20Nickname%20From%20His%20Exciting%20Fighting%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./composer-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Composers | Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-i-met-your-mother-ending.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened on the Ending of 'How I Met Your Mother'?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
