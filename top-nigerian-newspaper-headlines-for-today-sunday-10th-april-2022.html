style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today Sunday, 10th April 2022.</h2><p>The Presidency on Saturday denied viral reports that President Muhammadu Buhari has embarked on another trip to London.</p><p>The denial follows claims that&nbsp;President Buhari&nbsp;has embarked on a fresh 20-day vacation to London in the United Kingdom.</p><p>But the Personal Assistant to the President on Digital and New Media,&nbsp;Bashir Ahmad, in his reaction to the viral online report said the President is in Abuja.</p><p>He added that Buhari is not planning to embark on any trip to London.</p><p>Nigeria’s Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi has declared intention to contest in the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that Amaechi declared his ambition during the Rivers&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC)&nbsp;held in Port Harcourt today, Saturday.</p><p>Amaechi said, “I stand before you today to declare my intention and submit my application to serve as your next President.”</p><p>Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello has urged his colleagues to see the task of curbing insecurity as their responsibility.</p><p>Governor Bello made the call on Friday when he pointed out that&nbsp;President Muhammadu Buhari&nbsp;can’t be in every state to tackle the insecurity plaguing the land.</p><p>Specifically, the Kogi Governor said it is unexpected of the President to&nbsp;“hold an AK-47 to come and secure my schools and roads.”</p><p>He added that issues of insecurity must not be politicized as the State Governors must also do all within their powers to secure their states amidst the general challenges of insecurity in Nigeria.</p><p>Crisis may be brewing in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) following the directive of its national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, to reverse some decisions taken by the Governor Mai Mala Buni led Caretaker Chairman.</p><p>It was gathered that the order given to APC lawyers by Buni, before leaving office, to appeal judgements challenging congresses supervised by the caretaker committee has been reversed.</p><p>This is coming less than a week after Adamu disclosed his plans to look into the finances of the party under his predecessor.</p><p>Recall that the APC leadership had appealed a judgment of the Federal High Court recognising the Akwa Ibom State faction of the APC led by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, over that of the erstwhile Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe.</p><p>Unknown gunmen in the early hours of Saturday attacked the residence of the Commissioner of Environment in Plateau State, Usman Bamaiyi, abducting his wife and daughter.</p><p>It is unclear if Bamaiyi was at home when the gunmen invaded his residence located in the Gindiri community of Mangu Local Government Area of the state.</p><p>The incident was confirmed by the spokesperson of the state police command, ASP Ubah Gabriel.</p><p>Gabriel while confirming the incident said operatives of the Command are already on the trail of the abductors to ensure the safe rescue and release of the victims.</p><p>Jihad Analytics in its latest report claimed that Nigeria has overtaken Iraq as the country with the highest number of attacks by the Islamic State (IS).</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that Jihad Analytics is a consultancy company which processes data on global and cyber jihad.</p><p>Jihad Analytics stated that&nbsp;half of the attacks claimed by IS since the beginning of 2022 were in Africa.</p><p>It added that the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), an affiliate of IS, now carry out more attack in Nigeria.</p><p>Former Kogi lawmaker, Senator Dino Melaye has described the clamour for the zoning of political offices, particularly the 2023 presidency in Nigeria as archaic and analogue.</p><p>He argued that in place of zoning, the country needs to prioritize merit and those with the capability to get the work done.</p><p>Melaye made the submission on Friday during an interview appearance on Channels TV amidst the clamour for the&nbsp;2023 presidency&nbsp;to be zoned to the southern region of the country.</p><p>In condemning the calls for zoning, Senator Melaye questioned if the United States of America which is seen as the father of modern democracy also zones its political offices for election.</p><p>A special counsel to the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, Aloy Ejimakor, on Saturday noted that the IPOB leader would be granted bail on May 18, 2022.</p><p>Ejimakor stated this while reacting to the ruling of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja that struck out eight out of the 15-count charges against Kanu on Friday.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;had earlier reported that Justice Binta Nyako&nbsp;struck out the eight-count charges&nbsp;because the proof of evidence did not link Kanu to the charges.</p><p>Justice Nyako delivered the ruling on a preliminary objection Kanu raised against all the charges.</p><p>South-East Presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have called on the party to zone its ticket to the region.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that the aspirants made the demand while speaking to newsmen after their meeting&nbsp;in Abuja on Saturday.</p><p>Those at the meeting were Senator&nbsp;Anyim Pius Anyim,&nbsp;Peter Obi,&nbsp;Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Nwachukwu Anakwenze.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of the presidential aspirants, Anyim stated that they have agreed to work together as a team and that we will work together to ensure that a South Easterner emerges as PDP flag bearer.</p><p>Former Imo State Governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha has advanced reasons the All Progressives Congress (APC) should zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the south.</p><p>The Imo West Senator pointed out that the country is not ripe for political parties to start throwing their presidential tickets open.</p><p>He added that throwing the 2023 presidential ticket open is a wrong decision which might come back to hurt the nation from time to time.</p><p>Okorocha stated that in the spirit of fairness, equity and justice, the ticket should be zoned to the south and further micro-zoned within the region.</p><h2>That’s the
