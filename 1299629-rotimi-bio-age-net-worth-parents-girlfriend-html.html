His Yoruba father is an investment banker, while his Igbo mother is a civil servant. The talented 32-year-old is a dual citizen because he has Nigerian and American citizenship.</p><p class=align-left>Not much else is known about Rotimi parents. He is very proud of his roots but prefers to keep most details about them under wraps. His childhood was spent in America, where he attended high school and university, eventually graduating with a degree in Communication.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Rotimi <i>Power </i>role as Dre is the reason behind his recent celebrity status. However, this was not his first time on screen. He played significant roles in other shows such as <i>Divergent</i>, <i>Black Nativity</i>, <i>Imperial Dreams</i>, and <i>Boss</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/95d78c69c847635d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Aron Piper biography: age, height, parents, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0c018f504ddd94b4.jpg><p class=align-left>His career extends to the RnB genre of music. Rotimi songs are popular in West Africa, as well as internationally. His first two mixtapes, <i>The Resume</i> and <i>While You Wait</i>, had moderate success in the market. His latest EP album is titled <i>The Beauty of Becoming</i> and contains <i>Love Riddim</i>, one of his most successful singles.</p><p class=align-left>He is yet to go on tour but often performs at shows all over the world. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">His website </a>is constantly updated with the latest news about his music career. Coincidentally, <i>Power</i> actor Rotimi is signed to 50 Cent’s music label, G-Unit Records.</p><p class=align-left>The dislike viewers have for Dre on <i>Power</i> is what makes it hard for them to believe that the actor is actually a gifted singer. When asked about what he thinks of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">public’s attitude</a> towards his onscreen persona, Akinosho pointed out that he cannot do much to make people view him differently. Instead, he has learned to separate his identity in real life from the actor in <i>Power</i>.

Since then, there has been speculation on whether or not the two are dating. Their comments on each other’s Instagram pictures drew more attention to them.</p><p class=align-left>Eventually, they announced their relationship by posting each other’s photos on their Instagram pages. Vanessa Mdee later admitted to being in a relationship with the star.</p><h2>Rotimi net worth</h2><p class=align-left>It is not clear how much the celebrity is worth. What is certain is that his career is at its peak. Now that he is off the set of <i>Power</i>, Akinosho has several impressive projects lined up for 2020.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b93af3374ba50cce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sodapoppin (Chance Morris) biography: age, net worth, girlfriend, ban</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He is set to appear alongside Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall in the comedy <i>Coming 2 America</i>.
