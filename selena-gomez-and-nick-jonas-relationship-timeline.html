No matter how long it’s been, many have fond memories of their first significant relationships. However, it’s safe to say that most of those same people didn’t experience finding love and eventually going through heartbreak in the public eye like <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and <a href=#>Nick Jonas</a>.</p><p>If you were obsessed with everything <a href=#>Disney Channel</a> in the 2000s like we were, you probably know Selena and Nick dated after becoming famous on the Mickey Mouse platform. Although the relationship was short-lived, the celebrities seemingly didn’t have any ill feelings toward each other after breaking up. So, how long were they together? Here’s Selena Gomez and Nick Jonas’s relationship timeline.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">June 2008</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Multiple sources have stated that Selena and Nick’s relationship began in 2008. They were both already famous on the Disney Channel when they met, thanks to their music careers and Selena’s role as Alex Russo in <a href=#>Wizards of Waverly Place</a>. In June 2008, Selena played Nick’s love interest in The Jonas Brothers’ 2008 music video, “Burnin’ Up.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">December 2008</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>While Selena and Nick tried keeping their romance to themselves, the relationship soon became the subject of one of the earliest social media feuds on YouTube. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>, they started dating once Nick ended his two-year relationship with <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>. In August 2008, Miley shared her heartbreak with Seventeen Magazine, saying that Nick was “basically [her] 24/7” for two years. So, when she caught wind of Selena and Nick’s relationship, Miley decided to troll Selena on social media.</p><p>In December 2008, Miley posted a YouTube video of her and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mandy Jiroux</a> mocking Selena and her then-BFF, <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a>. The digs were pretty brutal for teens’ standards, as Mandy rocked a dramatic version of Demi’s eyeliner while she and Miley reenacted a video on Selena’s channel.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although the video ignited rumors that they were rivals, the Hannah Montana star quickly apologized to her Disney Channel co-workers, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">telling</a> Pop Star! Magazine that “were just, like, having fun.” Years later, in 2016, Selena confirmed to W Magazine that the “feud” was just a misunderstanding between two lovestruck teens.</p><p>"We never feuded," Selena declared. "We both liked the same guy when we were 16. It was just a <a href=#>Hilary Duff–Lindsay Lohan</a> thing: 'Oh, my God, we like the same boy!' We are now completely settled in our own lives."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">February 2010</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Shortly after the drama with Miley, Selena and Nick ended their relationship. Though it’s unclear what led to the split, they remained friendly throughout the years. In February 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> reported that Nick and Selena wanted to try dating again and were spotted together having dinner and going bowling.</p><p>At the time, a source claimed their relationship was "not at all as serious as Miley and Nick were," and they wanted to take things slow. Selena proved as much when she started her on-and-off relationship with <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> that same year.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">September 2015</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>If you’ve looked into Selena’s dating history, you’ll know that the Selena + Chef star has taken several shots at finding love. By 2015, she and Justin had broken up several times, and she also reportedly dated <a href=#>Niall Horan</a> and music producer Zedd when she and Justin were apart.</p><p>However, throughout it all, the actress always held on to fond memories of her prior relationship with Nick. In August 2015, the pair were spotted happily chatting at a VMA after party at which Joe Jonas was DJing.</p><p>A month later, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital FM</a>, Selena explained that her time with Nick bonded them forever. "We were babies!" she said. “We actually caught up the other day, and it’s really fun to be able to do that. That, to me, was like puppy love. It was very sweet. He’s lovely. I do have a love for him for sure."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">January 2018</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>All these years later, Selena and Nick have still managed to have a sense a humor about their relationship. In 2018, nearly a decade after their initial split, Nick appeared on BBC Radio 1's Heart Rate Monitor, where he answered several questions about his past. In one clip, Selena appeared on the screen and asked him to explain a date they had had.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nick said that back then, he and his brother Joe tried to keep their relationships as private as possible. During a group outing to Central Park, Nick said he felt they should stay “25 feet apart” to avoid dating rumors. While the action kept the paparazzi away, Nick admitted he “ruined” Selena’s trip to the tourist attraction. Fortunately, Selena isn’t upset by the Central Park diss anymore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbq3NnWSnoZOgequ7zZqqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fselena-gomez-and-nick-jonas-relationship-timeline.html&text=Inside%20Their%20Entire%20Relationship%20Timeline&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fselena-gomez-and-nick-jonas-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fselena-gomez-and-nick-jonas-relationship-timeline.html&title=Inside%20Their%20Entire%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fselena-gomez-and-nick-jonas-relationship-timeline.html&title=Inside%20Their%20Entire%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fselena-gomez-and-nick-jonas-relationship-timeline.html&title=Inside%20Their%20Entire%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fselena-gomez-and-nick-jonas-relationship-timeline.html&description=Inside%20Their%20Entire%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./722270-know-oliseh-say-critics-video-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Oliseh: Journalists request bribe from me (Video)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./does-sumit-want-to-marry-jenny-90-day-fiance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'90 Day Fianc' Fans Think Sumit Doesn't Want to Marry Jenny">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
