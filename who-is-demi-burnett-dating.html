She had a brash attitude and frequently called out the other women, so it was no surprise when she was asked to be on Season 6 of <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise.</a></p><p>Demi showed off a different side to her on Paradise. She was easily one of the most well-liked people on the beach, and her initial relationship with <a href=#>Derek Peth</a> was without drama.</p><p style=text-align:left>However, it wasn't before long that Demi broke it off with Derek so the woman she had been dating at home could join the show. Yup, Demi came out as bisexual, and her relationship with then-girlfriend, <a href=#>Kristian Haggerty</a>, was the first same-sex one to be featured on any show in the Bachelor franchise.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @demi_not_lovato</a></figure><p>But, shortly after <a href=#>getting engaged on the Paradise finale</a>, the two ended their relationship in October 2019.

Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Demi Burnett currently dating anyone?</h2><p>Demi Burnett does not appear to be currently dating anyone. In fact, she appeared on an episode of <a href=#>The Bachelor Season 28</a>, which aired on Jan. 29, 2024, where she indicated she was single.</p><p>Promoting her appearance on the show via Instagram, Demi teased in her caption that she had asked bachelor <a href=#>Joey Graziadei</a> if she could be a contestant on the season, confirming that she was single and was actively looking for love.</p><p>Although Joey didn't take her up on that offer, Demi still wrote that "[Joey's] hot and actually such a nice man." That said, ABC did find a way to incorporate her into the season, but not as a contestant, as she would have liked.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Demi Burnett (@demi_not_lovato)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Demi Burnett last known relationship was with Slater Davis for five months in 2020.</h2><p>Demi's last known relationship was with, Slater Davis, a singer and vlogger from Los Angeles.

"It's toxic on every level, whenever you get to that point where you're questioning everything each other's doing.

While Demi had initially hit it off with Derek Peth during Season 6 of Bachelor in Paradise, everything changed when Kristian came to the island.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @demi_not_lovato</a></figure><p>While Kristian was actually never part of the Bachelor franchise, she was specifically brought on because she and Demi had previously dated and producers wanted to test if their connection was still there. It was!</p><p>By the season finale which aired in Sept. 2019, Kristian proposed to Demi, and the ladies were engaged.</p><p>However, just a month later in October 2019, Demi and Kristian announced their separation in a <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>joint statement</strong></a> on social media. “What has always been at the forefront of our relationship is love and care for one another. Our priority is doing what is best for us,” Demi and Kristian said on Instagram at the time. “With a heavy heart full of love for one another we have decided it is best for us to take a step back from our relationship.”</p><p>Given how public Demi's relationships with Kristian and Slater were, it's understandable if she's been keeping her current dating life under wraps.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJ2dnZ56o8HRp5ytrF2ZrrW1zaA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-demi-burnett-dating.html&text=Is%20Demi%20Burnett%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Her%20Relationship%20History&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-demi-burnett-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-demi-burnett-dating.html&title=Is%20Demi%20Burnett%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Her%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-demi-burnett-dating.html&title=Is%20Demi%20Burnett%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Her%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-demi-burnett-dating.html&title=Is%20Demi%20Burnett%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Her%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-demi-burnett-dating.html&description=Is%20Demi%20Burnett%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Her%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./megan-ramsay-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Megan Ramsay - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./biafra-ipob-leader-nnamdi-kanu-launches-new-security-outfit-for-the-south.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="IPOB Leader, Nnamdi Kanu Launches New Security Outfit For The South">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
