While this came as a shock to some, legal documents revealed the two separated more than two years ago. Plus, this wasn't their first rodeo; <a href=#>their relationship was filled with plenty of ups and downs</a>, and they split in 2010 and 2013 before reconciling both times.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems they won't be getting back together this time because Billy Ray has a new love in his life. Enter Firerose, the new girlfriend fiancée of the 61-year-old legendary musician. Who is she? Here's everything we know about Firerose, including details on their recent engagement.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @firerose</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Firerose?</h2><p>Firerose is a singer-songwriter; according to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a>, she was born and raised in Sydney, Australia to "a family of symphony musicians." Like most aspiring artists these days, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career.</p><p>She noted on her website that she's had a "lifelong passion for songwriting," adding, "I always believed that my purpose on earth was fulfilled by music. ... Helping people up with a song I wrote gives everything so much meaning. I write from a place in my soul that's unexplainable, and I'm incredibly grateful for this gift that allows me to touch people so profoundly."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Billy Ray Cyrus (@billyraycyrus)</a></p></figure><p>Since she was a child, Firerose has been inspired by various artists; however, her biggest inspirations are <a href=#>Sia</a> and <a href=#>Alanis Morisette</a>, as well as Australian rock bands like Powderfinger, INXS, and Silverchair.</p><p>"I felt something cutting edge from the music of those artists that I listened to growing up that spoke to me deeply and cut through the noise of all the classical music I was surrounded with,” Firerose wrote on her website.</p><p>As of this writing, Firerose has five songs available to stream:</p><ul><li>"Fragile Handling"</li><li>"Way Out"</li><li>"No Holding Fire"</li><li>"New Day" (with Billy Ray Cyrus)</li><li>"All Figured Out"</li></ul><p>Regarding her chart-topping track with her collaborator-turned-lover, the Australian singer stated on her website that "New Day" came to her "a few years ago when I was going through some brutal personal stuff."</p><p>"I can honestly say that writing songs was the only thing that kept me breathing. As things got harder, I listened to it over and over and it gave me hope at the end of the tunnel," Firerose added. "Once I got through that period, I put it aside ... Then when the pandemic hit, I thought, if there was ever a time when a song of hope and rebirth was needed, this is it. Here we are with this promise of a new day we had all been praying for."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Firerose on Billy Ray and Miley Cyrus's hit series 'Hannah Montana'?</h2><p>Was their romance fated?</p><p>Though Firerose did not make an appearance on the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana, Billy Ray confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that the pair initially met on the studio lot.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Billy Ray Cyrus (@billyraycyrus)</a></p></figure><p>"I loved doing that show," he said. "There's a couple of old pine trees on the lot that look like Tennessee. Tex and I would go out there in the middle of the day and he'd take care of his business and we'd stretch and I'd think how much I missed Tennessee. On that given day, Firerose came out of the front door. There was almost a moment of, I don't know, recognition. I was like, 'This girl's a star.'"</p><p>It was 2010 on the Tribune Studios lot in Hollywood. Firerose, then 22 years old, went over to say hello to Billy Ray and his pup.</p><p>"She told me she'd had an audition and I said, 'Well, I'm sure you got the job,'" he told the outlet. Following their serendipitous meeting, Billy Ray explained the two remained friends, and eventually became songwriting partners, before becoming romantically involved.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Firerose and Billy Ray Cyrus have reportedly confirmed their engagement!</h2><p>On Sept. 29, a source confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that Firerose and Billy Ray have been "dating for a little while," adding that the talented duo "grew close while working on music together."</p><p>On Nov. 16, the couple confirmed their engagement to People.</p><p>Sources like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> claimed that the ring could cost anywhere between $150,000 and $220,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJ%2Bhopq%2FsL%2FE</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-firerose.html&text=Meet%20Firerose%2c%20the%20Fiance%20of%20Legendary%20Musician%20Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-firerose.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-firerose.html&title=Meet%20Firerose%2c%20the%20Fiance%20of%20Legendary%20Musician%20Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-firerose.html&title=Meet%20Firerose%2c%20the%20Fiance%20of%20Legendary%20Musician%20Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-firerose.html&title=Meet%20Firerose%2c%20the%20Fiance%20of%20Legendary%20Musician%20Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-firerose.html&description=Meet%20Firerose%2c%20the%20Fiance%20of%20Legendary%20Musician%20Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sofia-carson-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sofia Carson - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./twitter-ban-malami-in-trouble-after-cryptocurrency-icon-was-seen-on-his-phone-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Malami In Trouble After Cryptocurrency Icon Was Seen On His Phone (Photo)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
